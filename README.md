#Honeymoon

Honeymoon is travel destination app written in Swift + SwiftUI. It incorporates the yes/no swiping feature seen on many dating apps, such as Tinder and Bumble.

The app presents the user with the most popular honeymoon destinations in the world, and they can swipe right for "want to visit" or left for "don't want to visit". 

The application also incorporates haptic feedback, the AVAudioPlayer module, and numerous animations to enhance the user experience. 

The primary purpose of this project was to improve my SwiftUI skills, but also to serve as the basic infrastructure for an alternative to Tinder & other dating apps on the market. As my proposed new dating app idea will include swiping as the main yes/no feature, many of the components of this repo shall be reused. This was a great first dive into the swiping feature, as well as popping items out of the array based off each travel card's CGFLoats (whether or not the user swiped right/left). 

The total project is > 1000 lines of code, and is designed for aesthetics and performance.
